# dolphinscheduler-sdk-java
the java sdk for operating dolphinscheduler 

# 1 Why do this?
In our company,dolphin scheduler becomes base system for our job.Then we want to operate dolphin scheduler by RPC instead of the web view.
however,dolphin scheduler has not support java sdk,only python sdk.so I do this



# 2 features
##  2.1 multi http client support
you cant use `dolphinscheduler-java-sdk` in 
* springboot project (we use `RestTemplate` for post rest request)
* other java project (we use `http-client` for post rest request)



## 2.2 multi version support

with dolphinscheduler's develop,the rest api maybe change,so we want to support dolphinscheduler 2.0.6 and 3.0 version



## 2.3 supported operations
